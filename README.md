## Starting the game
Use the dotnet CLI, Visual Studio, or any other means provided by the Dotnet framework to start the application.

The program will ask you to select and configure the game using stdin. Submit your answer with the enter (return) key.

Selecting pits to move stones from can be done via stdin also.
